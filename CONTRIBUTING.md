For local development, there isn't much to prepare:

1. Install the [Rust toolchain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
2. Optionally:

   - install [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) and, in the repo root,
   run `just` to learn of some more advanced commands available
   - set up [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts)
3. Fire away...
